# Elections Analysis



## Overview of Election Audit


We were tasked with helping Colorado Board of Elections (CBE) to perform and provide the election audit results to the election commission. In addition to the data that is known at the moment of the request, we were also tasked with providing additional information by county.



## Election-Audit Results


1.	***Total Voted***

We verified that total votes count matches what CBE had as well. The final vote count was at 369711.

2.	***Analysis by County***

Based on the provided information, we can analyze and understand voting trend by county. This shows not only who won, but potentially what area/location played the key role in this. The final results show that Denver County had the highest turnout with 82.8% electorate showing up.

It is also shown in the image/link below:

3.	***Analysis by Candidate***

Similar to the county data, we are able to show information for each running candidate. This information is the most important as it shows not only the winner, but also results for all other candidates. Based on the results, Raymon Anthony Doane had the least votes with only 3.1%.

4.	***Final Results***

By analyzing the available data, we were able to verify and present to CBE a quick summary of the most recent congressional elections. The script we have produces final output in a short summary that presents the most important key metrics based on the available data. We see that Diana DeGette won by receiving 272892 votes (73.8% of the overall voters).

## Election-Audit Summary and Recommendations


While information we had is very telling, it is not enough to analyze and provide a complete voters’ analysis. We can provide a few suggestions how to make analysis even more useful and informational.

* ***If using only the data we have***

To further understand the voters’ trends, we can also show voters preference for each candidate by each county (i.e. even though Denver county had the highest turnout, this county potentially could be the most polarized when it comes to voting). 

* ***If adding more data metrics***

While county is one of the key metrics/indicators, it is essential to know voters’ demographics as well. By adding more data metrics, we can analyze voters preferences and potentially needs (i.e. reform education system).


## Conclusion

We analyzed and confirmed the winner of the elections. The data we had was sufficient to so, however, moving forward we suggest to collect more information to see a bigger 
picture in the voters' trend.

# Congratulations, Diana DeGette!
